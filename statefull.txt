1-Our Kafka cluster contains three topics:
• The score-events topic contains game scores. The records are unkeyed and
are therefore distributed in a round-robin fashion across the topic’s
partitions.
• The players topic contains player profiles. Each record is keyed by a player
ID.
• The products topic contains product information for various video games.
Each record is keyed by a product ID.
2-We need to enrich our score events data with detailed player information. We can
accomplish this using a join.
3-Once we’ve enriched the score-events data with player data, we need to add
detailed product information to the resulting stream. This can also be accomplished
using a join.
4-Since grouping data is a prerequisite for aggregating, we need to group the
enriched stream.

5-We need to calculate the top three high scores for each game. We can use Kafka
Streams’ aggregation operators for this purpose.

6-Finally, we need to expose the high scores for each game externally. We will
accomplish this by building a RESTful microservice using the interactive queries
feature in Kafka Streams.
