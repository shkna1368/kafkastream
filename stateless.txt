1. Tweets that mention certain digital currencies (#bitcoin, #ethereum) should be
consumed from a source topic called tweets:
• Since each record is JSON-encoded, we need to figure out how to properly
deserialize these records into higher-level data classes.
• Unneeded fields should be removed during the deserialization process to simplify
our code. Selecting only a subset of fields to work with is referred to as
projection, and is one of the most common tasks in stream processing.
2. Retweets should be excluded from processing. This will involve some form of
data filtering.
3. Tweets that aren’t written in English should be branched into a separate stream
for translating.
4. Non-English tweets need to be translated to English. This involves mapping one
input value (the non-English tweet) to a new output value (an English-translated
tweet).
5. The newly translated tweets should be merged with the English tweets stream to
create one unified stream.
6. Each tweet should be enriched with a sentiment score, which indicates whether
Twitter users are conveying positive or negative emotion when discussing certain
digital currencies. Since a single tweet could mention multiple cryptocurrencies,
we will demonstrate how to convert each input (tweet) into a variable number of
outputs using a flatMap operator.
7. The enriched tweets should be serialized using Avro, and written to an output
topic called crypto-sentiment. Our fictional trading algorithm will read from
this topic and make investment decisions based on the signals it sees.
Now that the requirements have been captured, we can design our processor
